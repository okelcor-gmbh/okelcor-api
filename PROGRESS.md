| Proposal health checks in system health | 🔧 | |
| Fix 3 — `[proposal_items_missing]` diagnostic log on draft | 🔧 | Confirmed draft reads persisted `quote_request_items`; logs request-vs-persisted item counts |

---

## CRM-8 — Buyer Approval & Customer Lifecycle (Session 40)

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Buyer lifecycle fields on `customers` (tier, verification, health, risk, approval audit) | 🔧 | Additive; existing active customers backfilled verified/low-risk |
| `customer_verifications` table + CRUD | 🔧 | company_registration / vat_number / website / import_license / business_address / other |
| `customer_timeline_events` table (append-only) | 🔧 | created/converted/proposal_accepted/approved/tier/risk/block etc. |
| `customer_access_requests` table (customer→admin) | 🔧 | checkout / documents / wholesale_pricing / higher_tier |
| Approval profiles (CustomerApprovalService) | 🔧 | inquiry_only / approved_buyer / wholesale_buyer / restricted / blocked |
| Health scoring + risk bands (CustomerHealthService) | 🔧 | 80+/60+/40+/<40 → low/medium/high/critical |
| `GET /admin/customer-approvals` (queues + cards + filters) | 🔧 | |
| `GET /admin/customers/{id}/timeline` | 🔧 | |
| `POST /admin/customers/{id}/approval-profile` / `approve` / `reject` / `set-tier` / `risk` | 🔧 | approve/reject reuse existing routes, backward-compatible |
| `POST /admin/customers/{id}/health/recalculate` | 🔧 | |
| Verifications endpoints (GET/POST/PATCH) | 🔧 | rolls up customer verification_status + recomputes health |
| Admin access-request review (`/admin/customer-access-requests` + approve/reject) | 🔧 | approve grants the concrete CRM-4 flag |
| Customer portal access requests (`/auth/customer/access-requests`) | 🔧 | no internal risk/health exposed |
| Timeline hooks in convert-to-customer + proposal acceptance | 🔧 | |
| Buyer lifecycle health checks in system health | 🔧 | pending approvals / high-risk / pending access requests |
| **Fix** — approval unlocks customer login | 🔧 | Granting profiles now set onboarding_status=active + is_active + status=active (self-registered); lead-converted stay in invite flow |
| **Fix** — approval email (`ApprovedAccountEmail`) | 🔧 | Sent on approve/approval-profile for approved_buyer/wholesale_buyer only; logs + timelines sent/failed; never rolls back approval |
| **Fix** — `/auth/me` + login return fresh CRM-8 fields | 🔧 | is_active, buyer_tier, verification_status; presenter adds login_ready / pending_email_verification / pending_invitation |
| Backend feature tests (15, MySQL) | ✅ | `Crm8BuyerLifecycleTest` — 15 passed / 75 assertions (incl. end-to-end login after approval) |

---

## CRM-9 — Admin "Add Customer" Onboarding (Session 41)

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| `POST /admin/customers` — admin-driven onboarding | 🔧 | New `customers.create` permission (super_admin / admin / sales_manager) |
| B2B/B2C, company required for B2B (422 `required_if`) | 🔧 | Field-level errors for the modal |
| `access_level` → CRM-4 flags via `approveBuyer()` | 🔧 | Defaults to `approved_buyer` (quotes + checkout + documents); stamps approval audit + timeline |
| No-password create + single-use set-password invite | 🔧 | `send_invitation` toggle; invite sent synchronously, send status returned as `data.invitation_email` |
| Duplicate email → 422 `errors.email` | 🔧 | `unique:customers,email` |
| Invitation email failures no longer silent | 🔧 | `sendInvitationEmail()` catches + logs + reports; `invite`/`resend-invite` surface status too |
| `security_events.type` enum widened (audit-trail fix) | 🔧 | Migration adds customer-lifecycle types the code already logged (were silently blank in non-strict MySQL) |
| Feature tests (4 new, MySQL) | ✅ | `Crm8BuyerLifecycleTest` — 19 passed / 92 assertions |

---

## CRM-3 — Admin Notifications (Session 42)

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| `admin_notifications` table (new) | 🔧 | Generic per-admin-user feed; `type`/`link` reusable for future event types |
| `GET /admin/notifications` | 🔧 | List current admin's notifications, most recent first, + `unread_count` |
| `POST /admin/notifications/{id}/read` | 🔧 | Marks one as read; scoped to owning user (404 if not owned) |
| `POST /admin/notifications/read-all` | 🔧 | Marks all of current user's unread notifications as read |
| `AdminNotificationService::notify()` | 🔧 | Generic writer, try/catch logged (never throws) |
| `lead_assigned` trigger in `POST /admin/quote-requests/{id}/assign` | 🔧 | Fires when `assigned_to` changes to a new user (not on re-assign to same user) |

---

## CRM-3B — Admin Notification Center & Work Queue (Session 43)

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| `admin_notifications` extended (severity/body/action_url/related_type/related_id/dismissed_at/metadata) | 🔧 | Additive; `message`/`link` kept & mirrored from `body`/`action_url` |
| `AdminNotificationService` rebuilt | 🔧 | notifyUser / notifyPermission / notifyRoles / markRead / markAllRead / dismiss / unreadCount; legacy `notify()` wrapper kept |
| Dedupe (metadata `dedupe_key`) | 🔧 | Suppresses duplicate **unread**; recurring events pass `includeRead=true` (one per due-date) |
| `GET /admin/notifications` (filters: unread/type/severity/page) | 🔧 | Paginated, scoped to self, excludes dismissed |
| `GET /admin/notifications/unread-count` | 🔧 | |
| `POST /admin/notifications/{id}/read` / `read-all` / `{id}/dismiss` | 🔧 | Owner-scoped (404 if not owned) |
| `GET /admin/my-work` work queue | 🔧 | assigned leads / due follow-ups / proposals accepted / approvals + access requests (customers.manage) |
| Trigger: `lead_assigned` (assign endpoint) | 🔧 | |
| Trigger: `proposal_accepted` (public + authenticated) | 🔧 | Assigned owner, else `quotes.manage` fan-out; severity success |
| Trigger: `customer_access_requested` (portal) | 🔧 | `customers.manage` fan-out; severity warning |
| Trigger: `customer_approval_needed` (registration) | 🔧 | `customers.manage` fan-out; severity warning |
| Trigger: `quote_needs_review` (CRM-2) | 🔧 | `quotes.manage` fan-out; severity warning |
| `admin:notifications:due-followups` command (hourly) | 🔧 | Notifies assigned owner of due/overdue follow-ups; no customer emails |
| Backend feature tests (16, MySQL) | ✅ | `Crm3bNotificationsTest` — 16 passed / 46 assertions |

---

## Landing Pages — Tyre Wholesaler (Session 44)

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| `lead_metadata` JSON column on `quote_requests` | 🔧 | Attribution bag (utm_*/gclid/fbclid/referrer/landing_page + interest/volume) |
| `lead_source` + `lead_metadata` accepted on **`POST /api/v1/quote-requests`** | 🔧 | **The live path the frontend uses.** `quantity` now optional (NOT-NULL-safe fallback); attribution stripped from columns into `lead_metadata`; accepts nested `metadata{}` + flat `utm_*/gclid/fbclid/referrer` |
| EU VAT enforcement gated to `lead_source=website_quote` | 🔧 | Landing/ads leads (no VAT field) not hard-blocked at inquiry stage; website form unchanged |
| `POST /api/v1/leads/tyre-wholesaler` | 🔧 | Typed alternative intake (interest/volume enums, phone optional); not used by current frontend |
| Reuses CRM-2 quality gate + CRM-3 defaults + CRM-3B notifications | 🔧 | Side-effects extracted to shared `dispatchInquirySideEffects()`; `lead_metadata` via shared `buildLeadMetadata()` |
| Backend feature tests (11, MySQL) | ✅ | `WholesalerLandingLeadTest` — 11 passed / 51 assertions (covers `/quote-requests` landing path + VAT gate) |

**Frontend owns:** the `/tyre-wholesaler` page, landing header/footer, inventory overlays, the form UI, `/tyre-wholesaler/thank-you`, and analytics events. **Frontend posts the landing form to the shared `/quote-requests` endpoint** (via its `/api/customer/quote-requests` proxy) with `lead_source=tyre_wholesaler_landing` + `metadata{}` attribution.

---

## Locale Auto-Detection (country → language) (Session 45)

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| `config/i18n.php` (single source of truth) | 🔧 | Supported locales `en/de/fr/es` + default `en` + country→locale map + geo-header list |
| `App\Support\LocaleResolver` service | 🔧 | Priority: explicit `?locale=` → country (`?country=` then CDN geo headers) → `Accept-Language` → default `en` |
| `GET /api/v1/i18n/locales` | 🔧 | Returns supported locales, default, and full country→locale map (one fetch → client-side detection) |
| `GET /api/v1/i18n/resolve` | 🔧 | Resolves best locale; honours `?country=XX`, `?locale=`, `CF-IPCountry`/`X-Vercel-IP-Country`, `Accept-Language`. Returns `{ locale, country, source, is_default }` |
| Rule | 🔧 | Country with a supported language → auto-switch; every other country → English default. Anonymised CF `XX` ignored |
| Backend feature tests (15) | ✅ | `LocaleResolutionTest` — 15 passed / 59 assertions (no DB; pure config negotiation) |

**Frontend owns:** detecting the visitor's country (Vercel `request.geo` / Cloudflare), persisting the chosen locale (cookie/localStorage), the language switcher UI, and respecting a manual override. Backend is the authoritative country→language map so the two never drift.

---

## Lead Funnel Analytics (Session 46)

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| `GET /admin/quote-requests/funnel?from=&to=` | 🔧 | `quotes.manage`; funnel stages (leads→qualified→proposal_sent→converted) + rates |
| Breakdown by `lead_source`, `lead_customer_type`, month | 🔧 | conversion rate per group |
| UTM attribution from `lead_metadata` | 🔧 | utm_source/campaign/medium top-10 with conversions; only when column exists |
| Deploy-order-safe | 🔧 | Built on always-present `qualification_status`; enrichment guarded by `Schema::hasColumn` |
| Backend feature tests (4, MySQL) | ✅ | `LeadFunnelAnalyticsTest` — 4 passed / 17 assertions |

---

## Localized Emails / Documents — Infrastructure (Session 46)

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| `preferred_language` on `customers` (en/de/fr/es, default en) | 🔧 | Additive, guarded migration; in `$fillable` |
| Customer implements `HasLocalePreference` | 🔧 | Laravel auto-localizes any mail/notification sent to the customer |
| `lang/{en,de,fr,es}/emails.php` | 🔧 | EN complete (source); DE/FR/ES **drafted — need native-speaker review**; missing keys fall back to EN |
| Invitation email converted to `__()` (reference pattern) | 🔧 | HTML + text + subject localized; tested in all 4 languages |
| `preferred_language` accepted on register + profile, returned in `/auth/me` | 🔧 | |
| Backend tests (4) | ✅ | `CustomerEmailLocalizationTest` — 4 passed / 12 assertions |

**Follow-up (not done):** convert the remaining ~20 mailables + the trade-document PDFs to `__()`, and get professional DE/FR/ES translations. The plumbing is in place — each converted template starts working the moment its lang keys exist.

---

## Ops / CI (Session 46)

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| `DEPLOY_RUNBOOK.md` | 🔧 | Audited 10-migration deploy plan (backup → pretend → migrate → cache) + eBay secret rotation steps |
| `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | ✅ | Runs migrations + full suite against **MySQL 8** on push/PR — closes the SQLite/MySQL schema-drift gap |
| Fixed stale `AdminTokenGuardTest` (CI surfaced it) | ✅ | Predated mandatory 2FA + role→`permission:admins.manage` move; full suite now green on MySQL (**88 passed**) |

---

## Customer Portal Notifications — "Email = Inbox" (Session 47)

The customer-facing twin of the admin CRM-3B feed: every transactional email a
customer receives also writes a `customer_notifications` row with the same
subject/summary, surfaced in the portal bell + `/account/notifications`.
Frontend was already built behind graceful degradation; these endpoints activate
it with no FE deploy.

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| `customer_notifications` table + `customers.notification_preferences` JSON | 🔧 | Guarded/additive migration; indexes for polled unread-count + dedupe |
| `CustomerNotification` model | 🔧 | unread/visible/forCustomer scopes |
| `CustomerNotifier` service | 🔧 | notify / notifyByEmail / markRead / markAllRead / dismiss / unreadCount; dedupe (type:related:stage), email_sent_at refresh on resend, relative-URL guard, prefs + wantsEmail gating |
| 5 notification endpoints (list / unread-count / read / read-all / dismiss) | 🔧 | `auth/customer/notifications*`; scoped to self, excludes dismissed, newest first, per_page default 15 |
| 2 preference endpoints (GET/PUT) | 🔧 | `auth/customer/notification-preferences`; email_orders forced on, email_marketing opt-in |
| Trigger: account approved (`account_approved`) | 🔧 | CustomerApprovalService::sendApprovalEmail (email twin) |
| Trigger: access request approved/rejected (`access_request_update`) | 🔧 | In-app only (no email today) |
| Trigger: payment milestones (`payment_milestone`) | 🔧 | PaymentMilestoneEmailService — resolves account by order email |
| Trigger: trade doc sent (`document_ready`) | 🔧 | AdminTradeDocumentController::sendEmail |
| Trigger: proposal sent (`quote_ready`) | 🔧 | AdminProposalController::send |
| Trigger: quote received (`quote_received`) | 🔧 | QuoteRequestController acknowledgement |
| Trigger: password changed (`security_alert`) | 🔧 | CustomerAuthController::changePassword (urgent, always fresh) |
| Trigger: email verified (`welcome`) | 🔧 | CustomerAuthController::verifyEmail |
| Trigger: order placed/paid (`order_placed`) | 🔧 | PaymentController (bank-transfer `received` + Stripe `paid`) + AdminOrderController::markPaid (`paid`); stage-keyed dedupe |
| Trigger: order confirmation requested (`order_confirmation`) | 🔧 | AdminTradeDocumentController::sendAcceptanceRequest (email twin, warning) |
| Trigger: order confirmation accepted (`order_confirmed`) | 🔧 | CustomerQuoteAcceptanceController::acceptOrderConfirmation (in-app) |
| Trigger: shipped / delivered (`order_shipped`/`order_delivered`) | 🔧 | AdminOrderController::notifyShipmentStatus from both update + updateStatus (in-app; no mailable today) |
| Trigger: verification verified/rejected (`verification_update`) | 🔧 | AdminCustomerVerificationController::notifyVerificationOutcome (in-app) |
| Backend feature tests (MySQL) | ✅ | `CustomerNotificationsTest` 15 passed; **full Feature suite 103 passed / 365 assertions** after trigger wiring — no regressions |

**Remaining triggers (no source event yet):** `proposal_reminder` and
`announcement` have no existing email/job to hook onto — wire them when a proposal
reminder scheduler and an announcement broadcast are introduced, using the same
`CustomerNotifier::notify(...)` pattern. Per the contract, account-area i18n of
notification copy is a separate effort.

---

## Customer Invoices — Self-Healing Download (Session 48)

Hardened the customer-facing invoice section. Root cause: when invoice PDF
generation failed once at creation (Stripe webhook), `pdf_url` stayed null and
the customer could **never** self-serve it — the listing skipped regeneration
(invoice row already existed) and the download endpoint hard-404'd. Required a
manual `invoices:generate-missing-pdfs` CLI run by an admin.

| Fix | Status | Notes |
|-----|--------|-------|
| `InvoiceService::ensurePdf()` — single source of truth, self-healing | 🔧 | fast path → adopt canonical file → regenerate from order; repairs `pdf_url` |
| `GET /invoices/{id}/download` regenerates on demand | 🔧 | No more permanent 404 on null/missing pdf_url; 404 only when order truly gone |
| `GET /auth/invoices` self-heals released null-PDF invoices | 🔧 | `download_available` now reflects reality instead of staying false |
| `createForOrder()` PDF step now calls `ensurePdf()` | 🔧 | de-duplicated generation logic |
| Released-invoice email gets in-app twin (`document_ready`) | 🔧 | `AdminEuDeclarationController::acknowledge` — Email = Inbox |
| Order payload exposes invoice state | 🔧 | `GET /orders` + `/orders/{ref}`: `invoice_number` / `invoice_available` / `invoice_pending_release` / `invoice_download_url` (via new `Order::invoice()` relation) — lets FE show download vs "pending EU cert" |
| Compliance gate unchanged | ✅ | reverse-charge invoices still held (released_at null) until EU cert acknowledged; held invoices stay hidden from the customer list |
| Backend feature tests (13, MySQL) | ✅ | `CustomerInvoiceTest` — 13 passed; full suite 116 passed / 391 assertions |

See `FRONTEND_NOTE_invoices.md` for the frontend-facing summary + contract.

## Traccar GPS / Fleet Tracking (Session 49)

Open-source GPS tracking integration — Okelcor API as a REST client of a Traccar
server (runs elsewhere; demo server for trials). Admin fleet visibility +
customer-facing per-order delivery tracking. Config-driven, graceful degradation.

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| `config/services.php` traccar block | 🔧 | `TRACCAR_URL` + token (Bearer) or email/password (Basic) |
| `TraccarService` (REST client) | 🔧 | devices+positions, route, trips, geofences, status/ping; knots→km/h, m→km; `['error'=>…]` degradation |
| Admin endpoints (`tracking.view`) | 🔧 | `GET /admin/tracking/{status,devices,devices/{id},devices/{id}/route,devices/{id}/trips,geofences}` |
| Assign device to order (`orders.update`) | 🔧 | `PUT /admin/tracking/orders/{id}/device` → sets `orders.tracking_device_id` |
| Customer endpoint | 🔧 | `GET /auth/orders/{ref}/tracking` — scoped to own order, lean payload, `available:false` when none |
| `tracking.view` permission added | 🔧 | super_admin / admin / order_manager / sales_manager |
| Migration `orders.tracking_device_id` | 🔧 | guarded/additive (12th… 13th pending migration) |
| Customer tracking tied to shipment status | 🔧 | live only when order `shipped`; `delivered` state (no live route); reasons `no_device`/`not_shipped`/`order_cancelled`/`unavailable`; returns `order_status`+`delivered` |
| Customer trail = current trip | 🔧 | `currentTripRoute()` bounds route to latest trip start, capped at `TRACCAR_ROUTE_HOURS` (default 12) |
| Admin order payload exposes `tracking_device_id` | 🔧 | links order ↔ fleet device |
| "Track it live" on shipped notification | 🔧 | `order_shipped` notification gains live-tracking copy + `metadata.live_tracking` when a device is assigned |
| Delivery ETA + progress | 🔧 | `eta` block in customer tracking: arrival timestamp, minutes/distance remaining, `progress_percent`. Straight-line (haversine × road factor ÷ recent avg speed). `GeocodingService` (OSM Nominatim, cached) resolves destination; `DeliveryEtaService` computes. New `orders.dest_lat/dest_lon/route_total_km` |
| Admin set-destination override | 🔧 | `PUT /admin/tracking/orders/{id}/device` sibling: `…/destination` accepts a `{lat,lon}` pin or `{address}` (geocoded, 422 if not found) or `{}` to clear; resets `route_total_km` baseline. For sparse addresses where auto-geocode fails. `dest_lat/dest_lon` on admin order payload |
| Carrier type `bus` → `truck` | 🔧 | enum migration (data-safe) + validation + PDF labels ("Truck Freight"); Okelcor runs no bus freight |
| Backend feature tests (23, MySQL) | ✅ | `TraccarTrackingTest` (Http::fake) — 23 passed; full suite 139 passed / 457 assertions |

Setup: `TRACCAR_SETUP.md`. Frontend: `FRONTEND_NOTE_tracking.md`. Distinct from
the freight tracking (DHL + ShipsGo `GET /tracking/{container}`), which stays.

## Marketing Contacts & Bulk Email (Session 50)

Order manager needed to (1) import the contact database dropped in the repo
root (`contacts.csv`, Wix export, ~1,720 valid-email rows) and (2) send bulk
marketing emails to that list. New, separate from `customers` (no login
account created) and from `contact_messages` (contact-form inbox).

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| `marketing_contacts` table | ✅ | email/name/phone/company/country/vat_id/labels/source + `status` (subscribed/unsubscribed/unknown) + `unsubscribe_token` |
| `MarketingContactImportService` | ✅ | Same Wix CSV column layout as `WixCustomerImportService`; upserts by email; re-import can never silently flip an `unsubscribed` contact back to subscribed |
| `POST /admin/marketing-contacts/import` | ✅ | `marketing.manage` (super_admin/admin/order_manager); multipart CSV upload, same shape as the existing customer import endpoint |
| `GET /admin/marketing-contacts` (+ `/stats`, `DELETE /{id}`) | ✅ | Filters: status/company/country/search |
| `bulk_email_campaigns` + `bulk_email_campaign_recipients` tables | ✅ | Recipient list is snapshotted at send time; per-recipient sent/failed status so a queue retry never double-emails anyone |
| `GET/POST /admin/bulk-emails`, `GET /{id}`, `GET /recipient-count` | ✅ | `marketing.manage`; body_html run through the existing `ArticleHtmlSanitizer` (strips script/style/event handlers); `recipient-count` lets the UI preview audience size before sending |
| `SendBulkEmailCampaignJob` (queued) | ✅ | Resumable — only processes `pending` recipient rows; 150ms pacing between sends; unsubscribed contacts are hard-excluded, not just filtered |
| `BulkCampaignEmail` mailable + unsubscribe footer link | ✅ | `GET /marketing-contacts/unsubscribe/{token}` — public, token-based, same pattern as newsletter confirm |
| `marketing.manage` permission | ✅ | super_admin / admin / order_manager |
| Backend feature tests (8) | ✅ | `BulkEmailCampaignTest` — import/dedupe, unsubscribe-never-resubscribed, permission gating, sanitization, resumable send job, unsubscribe endpoint |

Deployed to production (migrations #16–18 applied).

**⚠️ Production requirement:** `.env` currently has `QUEUE_CONNECTION=sync`,
which means `SendBulkEmailCampaignJob` would run **inline during the HTTP
request** — sending ~1,700 emails synchronously will time out. Before using
this in production, set `QUEUE_CONNECTION=database` and run a persistent
worker (`php artisan queue:work`, under Supervisor) so campaign sends happen
in the background. Nothing else needs to change — the job is already written
to be queue-driver agnostic.

See `FRONTEND_NOTE_bulk-email.md` for the frontend-facing contract.

## Media Library ↔ Article Writer Integration (Session 51)

Goal: while writing an article, an editor should be able to browse the
existing Media Library and reuse/copy an image's URL instead of only being
able to upload a brand-new file. The Media Library API already existed
(`GET/POST/DELETE /admin/media`) but was an isolated bucket — none of the
content-specific upload endpoints (article cover/OG/body, hero slides,
brand logos, promotions) wrote into it, so nothing uploaded while writing
content ever became browsable/reusable from the Media panel.

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| `MediaLibraryService` (new, shared) | ✅ | Extracted the upload/resize/store logic out of `MediaController::store` so any upload flow can register a `Media` row the same way |
| `POST /admin/articles/{id}/body-image` now registers in Media Library | ✅ | Collection `articles`; response gains `media_id` alongside existing `url`/`path` — this is the "while writing articles" moment the ask was about |
| **Bug fix** — `Image::read()` / `->toJpeg()` calls | ✅ | `intervention/image` is pinned to **v4.0.0** in `composer.lock`, which removed both methods (`read` → `decode`, `toJpeg` → `encode(new JpegEncoder(...))`). This was already broken in production for the existing `POST /admin/media` upload endpoint — silently, since there was no test coverage before this session. Fixed in the shared service; both upload paths now use the correct v4 API. |
| **Bug fix** — `Media.created_at` not Carbon-cast | ✅ | `Media` sets `$timestamps = false`, so Eloquent's automatic date casting (`getDates()`) never applied to `created_at` — `MediaController::formatMedia()`'s `$m->created_at?->toIso8601String()` would fatal on any real row. Added explicit `'created_at' => 'datetime'` cast. Also latent/pre-existing, also uncovered before this session. |
| Backend feature tests (5) | ✅ | `MediaLibraryTest` — upload/list/delete round trip, permission gating, article body-image → Media Library integration |

Cover image and OG image uploads (`uploadImage`/`uploadOgImage`) were left as
direct per-article uploads (not registered in the Media Library) — those are
1:1 canonical assets replaced on re-upload, not something an editor browses
and reuses across articles, so wiring them in wasn't part of this ask.

Deployed to production — no migrations in this session (code-only fix).

## Proposal→PI Friction Fix + Real Carrier Tracking (Session 52)

Driven by a call with order manager Edinah Agalla (2026-07-02): (1) requiring
a separate Order-Confirmation acceptance after the customer already accepted
the Proposal was redundant friction; (2) she has to log into eBay/GLS
separately to see shipment status that should live in Okelcor's own admin
panel and customer portal — for eBay orders and directly-onboarded customers
alike.

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **Fix** — Commercial Invoice hidden from customer until fully paid | 🔧 | `Order::isFullyPaid()` (new); gates `TradeDocumentController` (list + download) and `OrderController`'s `trade_documents` payload. Previously visible/downloadable as soon as issued (only needed `deposit_paid` to generate) — contradicted what was promised on the call. Admin visibility unchanged. |
| Proposal→PI: Order Confirmation acceptance no longer mandatory | 🔧 | For CRM-7 proposal-driven orders (`quote_requests.proposal_accepted_at` set), `AdminTradeDocumentController::generateProforma()` now skips the OC-acceptance gate — proposal acceptance alone unlocks PI generation. Customer `trade_documents` visibility relaxed the same way. Direct/manual orders (no proposal history) keep the original gate unchanged. OC document itself still auto-generates and remains available, just isn't a hard prerequisite anymore. |
| `GlsTrackingService` (new) | 🔧 | GLS parcel Track & Trace client (GLS Group Developer Portal). Credential model confirmed against GLS's own docs: App ID + API Key + API Secret issued together per registered app — no separate "customer ID" (App ID ≠ Customer ID; there isn't one for this API). User has App ID/Key/Secret now (`GLS_APP_ID`/`GLS_API_KEY`/`GLS_API_SECRET`). **Still not activated** — the token-exchange and tracking endpoint paths (`GLS_API_TOKEN_ENDPOINT`/`GLS_API_TRACKING_ENDPOINT`) couldn't be verified from public docs (GLS's real API reference sits behind portal login and differs by country/subsidiary); left blank on purpose. Degrades cleanly to `['error' => ...]` until set, same pattern as `TraccarService`/`DhlTrackingService`. |
| `CarrierTrackingService` (new) | 🔧 | Routes an order to GLS / DHL (`DhlTrackingService`, reused) / ocean freight (`ShipsGoService`, reused — aggregates multiple lines incl. Maersk) by `carrier` name / `carrier_type` / `container_number`; normalizes to `{carrier, tracking_number, stage, events[]}`; persists events into the existing `order_shipment_events` table (deduped) so the admin's manual timeline and auto-synced data share one source of truth, and `orders.tracking_status` stays current. |
| `GET /admin/orders/{id}/shipment-tracking` (new) | 🔧 | `tracking.view` permission (reused from the Traccar fleet endpoints). Live carrier-API call + persists new events. Works for **eBay-sourced orders too** — no separate eBay-tracking pull needed, since eBay orders get the same `carrier`/`tracking_number` fields as any other order once shipped. |
| `GET /auth/orders/{ref}/tracking` extended with `mode` | 🔧 | Existing customer endpoint (Traccar GPS tracking) now returns `mode: "gps_live"` (unchanged behavior) or new `mode: "carrier"` when no fleet device is assigned but a carrier + tracking/container number is set. Carrier mode reads the persisted timeline (no live call on page view). `available:false` reasons unchanged. |
| `tracking:sync-carriers` command (new) | 🔧 | Hourly (`routes/console.php`, same pattern as `admin:notifications:due-followups`) — syncs shipped orders with a carrier+tracking number and no fleet device, keeping the persisted timeline fresh without a live call per page view. |
| Backend feature tests (16, MySQL, written not yet executed) | 🔧 | `ProposalToProformaGateTest` (6 tests) + `CarrierTrackingTest` (10 tests). **Not run against real MySQL in this session** — this dev environment's local MySQL root credentials don't match `.env`, so only `php -l` + bootstrap/autoload verification was possible. Run `php artisan test` before deploying. |

**GLS — both endpoints now confirmed from the account's own portal ("Try this
API" panels):**
- Token exchange (Authentication API v2): standard OAuth2 client-credentials —
  `POST /oauth2/v2/token`, HTTP Basic Auth (`api_key:api_secret`), form-encoded
  `grant_type=client_credentials` body.
- Tracking (ShipIT-Farm API v1): `POST /rs/tracking/parceldetails`, `Bearer`
  token from the exchange above, `Content-Type: application/glsVersion1+json`
  (GLS's own custom media type), body `{"ParcelNumber": "..."}`.

Both wired into `GlsTrackingService` + defaults in `config/services.php`.
**Still open:** the portal's tracking "Try it" panel returned "Unknown Error"
when tested without an Authorization header — consistent with needing the
Bearer token, but not yet proven end-to-end. Also still unconfirmed: the
token response's exact field name (`access_token` assumed) and whether
`parceldetails` actually contains a status/event-history field at all, or
only static shipment attributes (weight/product/addresses) per GLS's public
docs for the equivalent legacy endpoint — needs one real end-to-end run
(token exchange → Bearer token → parceldetails with a live parcel number) to
confirm before trusting this in production. DHL and ocean-freight (incl.
Maersk) tracking are live now — both already had working credentials.

11. `2026_06_25_000001_add_preferred_language_to_customers_table` (localized emails/documents)
12. `2026_06_28_000001_create_customer_notifications_table` (customer portal notifications + notification_preferences)
13. `2026_06_28_000002_add_tracking_device_to_orders_table` (Traccar GPS — orders.tracking_device_id)
14. `2026_06_29_000001_change_carrier_type_bus_to_truck_on_orders` (carrier_type bus → truck, data-safe)
15. `2026_06_29_000002_add_delivery_eta_fields_to_orders` (dest_lat/dest_lon/route_total_km for ETA + progress)
16. `2026_07_01_000001_create_marketing_contacts_table` (Session 50 — bulk email)
17. `2026_07_01_000002_create_bulk_email_campaigns_table` (Session 50 — bulk email)
18. `2026_07_01_000003_create_bulk_email_campaign_recipients_table` (Session 50 — bulk email)

All 18 verified to apply cleanly on MySQL via CI (`migrate:fresh`) and `LeadFunnelAnalyticsTest`'s `RefreshDatabase`; #16–18 were additionally exercised against sqlite in `BulkEmailCampaignTest`. Applied to production via `artisan migrate --force` as part of the 2026-07-01 deploy (which also shipped Session 51's code-only Media Library fix — no new migrations there). See `DEPLOY_RUNBOOK.md` for the ordered deploy + rollback plan. No migrations currently pending.

⚠️ Bulk email is deployed but **not yet safe to use for a real send**: `.env`
still has `QUEUE_CONNECTION=sync`, so `SendBulkEmailCampaignJob` would run
inline during the HTTP request. Set `QUEUE_CONNECTION=database` and run a
queue worker before the order manager sends to the full contact list — see
Session 50 note above.
